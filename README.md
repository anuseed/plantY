I really stuggled with flexbox and making sure I had selected the correct children and their parent, a lot of it was trail and error in the end, although inspecting the page was very useful to help with this.
Margins and padding were also a pain as these kept moving my images so they weren't aligned properly on the page depending on the screen size, would be nice to know if there was an easy fix for this.
I also found it hard to not try and make the website look "pretty" even after I had finished the techinical aspects of it. So it all took me a lot longer than I really would have wanted to spend on an assignment in the future.
Stackoverflow was very useful to find quick snipits of code that I could read to understand an issue I had.
I used the html and css cheat sheet A LOT!
Common errors I had were typos especially with classes, which meant my code stopped working or the changes I had expected did not work.
Another issue I had intially was not running the code frequently enough so debugging the problems that arose took a lot of time.
Adding sections after the fact also resulted in lots of syntax issues which took a while to fix.
I attributed to sources in my html and css with comments, there may be a better way to do so, but worked for me this time.
For the social media icons I followed this tutorial https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_social_media_buttons.asp and added the code they suggested to the html and css.
Overall I am pretty happy with the final result, I ended up not adding music or adding a back to the top button (this was also because I had the nav bar scroll down with you so didn't seem necessary).
I wanted to try to learn markdown to type this but I think this will have to do for now.s
